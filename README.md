# Live Record

- Live record is a Unity Debugging tool, designed to help developers and testers constantly catch and record bugs.

- It works by constantly keeping the last 600 frames in memory and saving the frames in memory to the persistent storage of the device with a click of a button.

- It captures the gameplay screen every 3 frames so the recording is in 20 frames per second for a 60 fps game.

- It is a debugging tool and is not suitable for recording high quality video.
